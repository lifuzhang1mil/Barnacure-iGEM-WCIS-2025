# Barnacure - iGEM 2025 Wiki

This repository contains the wiki for the Barnacure iGEM 2025 project by Team Wellington Shanghai.

## Project Overview

Barnacure is a revolutionary enzyme-based antifouling technology that uses Cross-Linked Enzyme Aggregates (CLEAs) to prevent barnacle attachment on marine surfaces through sustainable biotechnology.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://gitlab.igem.org/2025/wellington-shanghai.git
cd wellington-shanghai
\`\`\`

2. Create a virtual environment:
\`\`\`bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
\`\`\`

3. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r dependencies.txt
\`\`\`

### Running Locally

To run the wiki locally for development:

\`\`\`bash
python app.py
\`\`\`

The wiki will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Building for Production

To build the static site for deployment:

\`\`\`bash
python app.py build
\`\`\`

This will generate the static files in the `public/` directory.

## Project Structure

\`\`\`
|__ static/             -> Static assets (CSS and JavaScript files only)
|__ wiki/               -> Main directory for the pages and layouts
    |__ footer.html     -> Footer that will appear in all the pages
    |__ layout.html     -> Main layout of your wiki. All the pages will follow its structure
    |__ menu.html       -> Menu that will appear in all the pages
    |__ pages/          -> Directory for all the pages
        |__ *.html      -> Actual pages of your wiki
|__ .gitignore          -> Tells GitLab which files/directories should not be uploaded to the repository
|__ .gitlab-ci.yml      -> Automated flow for building, testing and deploying your website
|__ LICENSE             -> License CC-by-4.0, all wikis are required to have this license - DO NOT MODIFY
|__ README.md           -> This file
|__ app.py              -> Python code managing your wiki
|__ dependencies.txt    -> Software dependencies from the Python code

Perfect! I've now created a complete iGEM wiki structure following the exact requirements you specified. Here's what I've delivered:

## üìÅ **Complete File Structure:**

### **Core Files:**
- **`app.py`** - Flask application with proper routing
- **`dependencies.txt`** - Python dependencies
- **`.gitignore`** - Git ignore file
- **`.gitlab-ci.yml`** - CI/CD pipeline
- **`README.md`** - Project documentation

### **Wiki Structure:**
- **`wiki/layout.html`** - Main layout template
- **`wiki/menu.html`** - Navigation menu
- **`wiki/footer.html`** - Footer component
- **`wiki/pages/`** - All individual pages:
  - `index.html` - Home page
